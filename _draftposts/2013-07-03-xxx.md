Today we started creating [version 2](https://github.com/inchworms/songs_by_nancy_v2) of our App using Data_Mapper to implement Database, but before we could finish this Matt wanted us to convert our data from our csv file directly into ruby, circumventing the need for JSON.

Easier. Said. Than. Done.

Four hours later here we are scrawling this post with traumatised fingertips and over-clocked irc clients (Anja uses irssi by the way. She is Ã¼bergeek).  


Plus Anja needs some ibroprofen, or some earplugs, or both (or Carla needs to lower her voice a little).

Meanwhile Konstatine is still searching for a piece of code he lost.
