Scatterplot and dancing capsules

We went on with the Data Vizualisation book and read about scaling data values. As (Mike Bostocks)[https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/quantitative-scales] says: <i>Scales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range.</i>

We did the learning-by-repeatetion style. As you can hear:

Today we took the next step in visualization. After creating bar charts yesterday we moved on to scatterplots. Now we just need usefull Data! Give us Data! Ach, we will find some and (colorize)[https://kuler.adobe.com/Theme-2-color-theme-2785170/edit/?copy=true] them nicely :)...
