Today we were super excited about the fact, that we won a ticket and flight to Kiew in September to the [rubyshift](http://rubyshift.org/). Ukraine we are coming!

We alreday downloaded our tickets.

We decided to update our Ruby knowledge in between all the testing, so we fight with the monsters in the [Ruby Warrior](https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior#/warriors/29136/levels/6) and at level 6 the monsters were constantly wining :(

And we are about to refactor the Sinatra Tests. Remember Red -> Green -> Refactor! Well now we are back to Step one in a Test again. Lots to do!

Thats how it sometimes feels!
