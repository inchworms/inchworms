We spend half the morning with trying to get the printer driver to run and print on Anja's computer. To print our the Eurucamp-ticket. Well we didn't get it. After hours Carla tried to print from her computer, which always worked and siehe da, the printer was put of color.
Well trolled!

So we don't have a printed eurocamp but we hope they will let us in tomorrow anyway!

Then we went on with the book. Today we proceed with the chapter geomapping. Which gave us some really nice [examples](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3711652) off how to draw a map with d3.

Then we draw our first map with d3. Zuf√§lligerweise auch really reports of agricultural productivity in the USA during the year 2004. Fits perfectly to our next project. This time it took only about half an hour to get the tooltips working.
