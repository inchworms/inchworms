Today we made a little Kiev tour. We went into church caves where Kostantin and Anja nearly collapsed. It was very cramped, everybody had a burning candles in their hands, people kissed coffins, and there were no emergency exits! We weren't even allowed to take photos (but rebel Anja took one anyway).

Luckily we survived and went to the Motherland monument ("Мати-Батьківщина"). As you can see ...
