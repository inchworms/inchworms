During the weekend, I went to the Railscamp in [Cologne] (http://2013.railscamp.de/). It took place in the adventures halls (appropriate name) and was a great mixture of coding and doing sports. Or playing with the waterpistol. Or talking to people. Or watching the quatrocopters... Actually there were lots to do.

First thing I did was learning how to secure a climber and how to climb myself. Pretty exciting to be up there and the rope is being hold by someone who does that the first time.

Bettina can't get enough

[@Sabrina](https://twitter.com/sabrna) and [@Bettina](https://twitter.com/ThatBettina) from the [rubymonsters](https://github.com/rubymonsters) where there as well and our plan was to work a bit on our Speakerinnen App. Some advanced coders took their time to go with us trough the code and fixed ALL the tests and showed us, how to keep the overall view on a large (at least for us ;) ) project. Thanks a lot!!!

On sunday was a railsgirls meeting with the organizers and attendies from cologne and some other Cities, even one Railsgirl from London. The aim of the cologne railgirls was to write an app for the railsgirls community get better organized. After a lot of talking and brainstorming it was democratically decided to first focuse on an app to centralize all the rails girls projects. That app should make it easier for interested woman to propose a project, find a project or find a coach for a railsproject. I am looking forward to see it!

The best coding stuff I learned on the Railscamp was the sublime package githubinator. After installing it, you open your document which has a github repro and click with you right mousebutton on a line in the code and choose "githubinator blame" and tada, there opens the github webseite and you see who of the rubymonsters has been the perpetrator of that piece of code. Nice tool! Always good to know who to blame. 

The funny thing about programmers I learned was, every programmer is recommending something else. And then they start to discuss which way is better. And I end up totally confused.

It was a great weekend! At any time again! Best Anja
