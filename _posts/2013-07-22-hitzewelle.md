Berlin. 30 degrees in the shade. Everywhere we look Germans are melting. But not our mentor Stefan, the [Bjorn Borg](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sportacademy/hi/sa/tennis/features/newsid_3253000/3253694.stm) of Open Data.

We met with [Stefan](http://stefanwehrmeyer.com/) in the morning to discuss the EU FarmSubsidy project we'll work on in the later part of our Summer of Code. We covered a lot of ground, discussing possible libraries to use, different software that might be helpful, alternate visual approaches, and formulated a rough plan for how we should initially proceed. (Carla was also happy to find data about her uncle's small farm in Sicily).

Then it was back to the Travis CI office to continue with our Sinatra tests. 

The coding was 15% more fun today thanks to glistening nail polish provided by [@meivx](https://twitter.com/meivx). We are thinking of making her our official inchworms stylist.

We needed more fun because while it may have been the heat, the long list of Sinatra routing tests started to intimidate us. Especially when we realised the list we wrote last week only included the 'get' portion of routing requests (not the 'post', 'put', 'delete', 'head', 'options', 'patch', 'link', 'unlink' requests). Eeek!

We found something Matt called a [rabbit hole](http://youtu.be/3ppsDNkBLGY?t=1m1s) (to do with disabling Rack protection) and had test results totally splatter our screens with red, as if an RSpec chainsaw had been unleashed.

Our work continues...
