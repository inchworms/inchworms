The heatwave continues.

(Note the dim lighting. It's so hot in Berlin that even at 9am all the shutters are drawn.)

It was ice cream for lunch and iced coffee (courtsey of [@raphaelawrede](https://twitter.com/raphaelawrede)) for afternoon tea.

The routing tests continue and, slowly slowly, it feels like comprehension is solidfying.

Hope everyone has a great weekend. We're off to find an icebox to move into...
