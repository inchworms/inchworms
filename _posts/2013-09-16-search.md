The search function now works, which is pretty amazing.

![search](/images/search_function.png)

with a simple:

    get '/' do
      if params[:name]
        @recipients = Recipient.where(Sequel.ilike(:name, "%#{params[:name]}%"))
      else
        @recipients = Recipient.all
      end
      erb :index
    end


And once you click a link, you can see all the payments listed and even a tiny graph. We are graph-addicted!
