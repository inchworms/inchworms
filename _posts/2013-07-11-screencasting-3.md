... Tutorial Part 3 is still in progress. Issues related to deploying to heroku carried on into the late afternoon. They remain unresolved. We'll finish editing the bulk of the screencast this evening. Anja will see if she can get heroku deploy working on her machine. 

@Bioshrimp did a drawing of grumpy Carla. Which we love.
