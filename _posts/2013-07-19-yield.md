Do not doubt this man. He will take a statement like **yield** and break it into meta-programmed chunks. All before breakfast (smells a lot like RGSoC spirit to us ;-))

*Very* simply, a **yield** statement will invoke a **block**. This is all you really need to know.

The rest of the day we spent writing the [routing spec](https://github.com/inchworms/sinatra_tests/blob/master/spec/routing_spec.rb) for our Sinatra testing and refactoring it all into beautifully contextualised syntax. Here's a list of the remaining Sinatra routing tests we need to write:

+ allows using unicode
+ it handles encoded slashes correctly
+ overrides the content-type in error handlers
+ matches empty PATH_INFO to "/" if no route is defined for ""
+ matches empty PATH_INFO to "" if a route is defined for ""
+ takes multiple definitions of a route
+ exposes params with indifferent hash
+ merges named params and query string params in params
+ supports optional named params like /?:foo?/?:bar?
+ supports named captures like %r{/hello/(?<person>[^/?+ ]+)} on Ruby >= 1.9
+ supports optional named captures like %r{/page(?<format>.[^/?+ ]+)?} on Ruby >= 1.9
+ does not concatinate params with the same name
+ supports single splat params like /*
+ supports mixing multiple splat params like /*/foo/*/*
+ supports mixing named and splat params like /:foo/*
+ matches a dot ('.') as part of a named param
+ matches a literal dot ('.') outside of named params
+ literally matches dollar sign in paths
+ literally matches plus sign in paths
+ does not convert plus sign into space as the value of a named param
+ literally matches parens in paths
+ supports basic nested params
+ exposes nested params with indifferent hash
+ exposes params nested within arrays with indifferent hash
+ supports arrays within params
+ supports deeply nested params
+ preserves non-nested params
+ matches paths that include spaces encoded with %20
+ matches paths that include spaces encoded with +
+ matches paths that include ampersands
+ URL decodes named parameters and splats
+ supports regular expressions
+ makes regular expression captures available in params[:captures]
+ supports regular expression look-alike routes
+ raises a TypeError when pattern is not a String or Regexp
+ returns response immediately on halt
+ halts with a response tuple
+ halts with an array of strings
+ sets response.status with halt
+ transitions to the next matching route on pass
+ transitions to 404 when passed and no subsequent route matches
+ transitions to 404 and sets X-Cascade header when passed and no subsequent route matches
+ uses optional block passed to pass as route block if no other route is found
+ passes when matching condition returns false
+ does not pass when matching condition returns nil
+ passes to next route when condition calls pass explicitly
+ passes to the next route when host_name does not match
+ passes to the next route when user_agent does not match
+ treats missing user agent like an empty string
+ makes captures in user agent pattern available in params[:agent]
+ matches mime_types with dots, hyphens and plus signs
+ filters by accept header
+ filters by current Content-Type
+ allows multiple mime types for accept header
+ respects user agent preferences for the content type
+ accepts generic types
+ prefers concrete over partly generic types
+ prefers concrete over fully generic types
+ prefers partly generic over fully generic types
+ respects quality with generic types
+ supplies a default quality of 1.0
+ orders types with equal quality by parameter count
+ ignores the quality parameter when ordering by parameter count
+ properly handles quoted strings in parameters
+ accepts both text/javascript and application/javascript for js
+ accepts both text/xml and application/xml for xml
+ passes a single url param as block parameters when one param is specified
+ passes multiple params as block parameters when many are specified
+ passes regular expression captures as block parameters
+ supports mixing multiple splat params like /*/foo/*/* as block parameters
+ raises an ArgumentError with block arity > 1 and too many values
+ raises an ArgumentError with block param arity > 1 and too few values
+ succeeds if no block parameters are specified
+ passes all params with block param arity -1 (splat args)
+ allows custom route-conditions to be set via route options
+ raises an ArgumentError with block param arity 1 and no values
+ raises an ArgumentError with block param arity 1 and too many values
+ matches routes defined in superclasses
+ matches routes in subclasses before superclasses
+ adds hostname condition when it is in options
+ allows using call to fire another request internally
+ plays well with other routing middleware
+ returns the route signature
+ sets env['sinatra.route'] to the matched route

See you sometime next decade...
