Today we started creating [version 2](https://github.com/inchworms/songs_by_nancy_v2) of our app using DataMapper to implement basic database functionality. But before we could finish this Matt wanted us to improve our initial version of the app by converting our data directly from a csv file into Ruby (thereby circumventing the need for a JSON file altogether).

This was easier said than done.

Four hours later we found ourselves bashing our keyboards with traumatised fingertips and over-clocked irc clients (Anja uses irssi by the way. She is Ã¼bergeek).

Anja was in need of ibroprofen or earplugs (or both), and Carla needed to lower her voice a little. What seemed relatively simple with JSON.parse was completly confounding with CSV.parse. Most of it boiled down to the fact that JSON could parse an array of hashes, but CSV needed more coaxing. ANYWAY. Urs thankfully indicated a few blindingly obvious syntax errors that had been staring us in the face all along. A missing comma here, a misplaced hash there, you know the drill. It really is true that staring at code for hours can make normal vision pretty much impossible.

Meanwhile, if that didn't make the day crazy enough, Konstatine had his own vision impairments, spending most of it searching for a piece of code he just couldn't find...
