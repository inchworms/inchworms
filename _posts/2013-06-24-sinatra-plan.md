Tonight we met with coach [@fidothe](https://twitter.com/fidothe) and mentor [@konstantinhaase](https://twitter.com/konstantinhaase) to devise a plan for what we would work on for the [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) leg of our program.

Our first task will be to familiarise ourselves with Sinatra, referring in the first instance to the comprehensive [Readme](https://github.com/inchworms/sinatra/blob/master/README.md) documentation.

We'll then spend the first week/week-and-a-half building a sample application that covers how routes, templates, and error handling work. We'll make a screencast that can be used as a guide for others wanting to learn Sinatra basics.

We'll then spend the next two weeks re-writing our sample application using test driven development, and produce a screencast that demonstrates how to test a Sinatra application.

We'll then spend the remainder of our time writing some tests in rspec to test the Sinatra framework itself, focusing primarily on the behaviour we used in our sample app - routes, templates, and error handling (our template tests will cover high level template behaviour only).

We'll work on our [own fork](https://github.com/inchworms/sinatra) of the Sinatra repository.

Bis montag...
