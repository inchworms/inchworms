    puts "Hello, Summer of Code!"

Greetings world from [@tyranja](https://twitter.com/_tyranja_) and [@CarlaD](https://twitter.com/CarlaD). 

Accompanied by our ninja coaches [@fidothe](https://twitter.com/fidothe) & [@ur5](https://twitter.com/ur5), and jedi mentors [@stefanwehrmeyer](https://twitter.com/stefanwehrmeyer) & [@konstantinhaase](https://twitter.com/konstantinhaase), we'll be posting updates here about progress on our [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) projects - Sinatra and farmsubsidys.org.

We're anticipating a heady summer of coding, committing, and cricket (well, [@CarlaD](https://twitter.com/CarlaD) & [@fidothe](https://twitter.com/fidothe) will be fighting over something called [The Ashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes) which we understand to be an tiny old ceramic urn of stump ashes... go figure...)

So, welcome to our blog! We're super glad to have you along for the ride and can't wait to get started.
