    puts "Hello, Summer of Code!"

Greetings world from [@tyranja](https://twitter.com/_tyranja_) and [@CarlaD](https://twitter.com/CarlaD). 

Accompanied by our ninja coaches [@fidothe](https://twitter.com/fidothe) & [@ur5](https://twitter.com/ur5), and jedi mentors [@stefanwehrmeyer](https://twitter.com/stefanwehrmeyer) & [@konstantinhaase](https://twitter.com/konstantinhaase), we'll be posting updates here about progress on our [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org/) projects - Sinatra and farmsubsidys.org.

We're anticipating a heady summer of coding, committing, and cricket (well, [@CarlaD](https://twitter.com/CarlaD) & [@fidothe](https://twitter.com/fidothe) will be fighting over something called [The Ashes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ashes) which we understand to be a tiny old ceramic urn of stump ashes... go figure...)

So, welcome to our blog! We're super glad to have you along for the ride and can't wait to get started.
