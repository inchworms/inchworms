Rubyshift is over. Way too soon. We have enjoyed doing nothing but sitting and listening to speakers. Or, in Carla's case, reading her novel. We would be happy to do this forever...

Some people were so exhausted they even slept on the couch in reception and started to snore. Like [@Jorge](https://twitter.com/xurdeonrails), from Spain (we <3 u Jorge!)

Now we have time to conquer the city. We have one more day to here. It's gonna be awesome!

Tonight we went with [@Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevintriplett) to the People's Friendship Arch.
