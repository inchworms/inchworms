Today we watched an excellent [video tutorial](https://peepcode.com/products/rspec-i) by PeepCode to learn more about RSpec. It covered:
		
+ Learning the basic concept of the RSpec testing framework
+ Learning the syntax of RSpec
+ Using Rspec in isolation with a basic Ruby project
+ Understanding the **describe** and **it** methods

Some key RSpec syntax:

		expect(thing).to eq 'result'	

And also:	

- Understanding the red/green cycle of development
- Implementing the first feature of the application
- Creating a client and giving it a URL
- Using an [HTTP Client app](https://plus.google.com/104025798250320128549/posts) to see what a URL returns when sent a request
- Fetching an XML feed
- Parsing the XML of the comments feed
- Using the **let** method to simplify setup
- Using nested **describe** blocks
- Organising application code
- Debugging and fixing errors in RSpec code
- Parsing extra fields
- Working with unexpected Unicode input
- Using trivial examples to catch errors and expose assumptions

You can look at the code on [GitHub](https://github.com/inchworms/tutorial_commentsdashboard).

Then we started working on [Part 2](https://peepcode.com/products/rspec-ii) of the PeepCode tutorial, which we'll finish tomorrow.

Oh yeah, we had a yummy lunch at [Co.Up](http:co-up.de) with Matt and Urs (and Nabil, Andy, and Hannah)...
