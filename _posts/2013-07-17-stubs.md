Today we watched the rest of Part 2 of PeepCode's excellent [RSpec video tutorial](https://peepcode.com/products/rspec-ii). This one covered:
		
**The three stages of testing**

+ Automated testing with RSpec
+ Manual Testing with QA testing
+ Production deployment with customers

**API discovery**

+ Writing an example to describe expected output
+ Learning how an API works by writing examples
+ Using XPath syntax with Nokogiri (although [@svenfuchs](https://twitter.com/svenfuchs) suggested using CSS instead)
+ Extracting the author name from an RSS feed

**Custom Matcher**

+ Extracting a post's publication date
+ Parsing an XML date into a Ruby object
+ Writing a custom matcher (see David Chelimsky's [wiki](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/custom-matchers))
+ Verifying the parsing of the date object

**Configuration Options**

+ Creating a .rpsec file
+ Understanding the options in the rspec command
+ Using an alternate report formatter
+ Setting custom options as the default

**Retrieving Data**

+ Retreiving data from an external server
+ Organising network code for easier testing

**Stubs & Mocks**

+ Understanding stubs and mocks
+ Using paceholder code to make your examples faster and more consistent
+ Intercepting network calls with a stub
+ Expecting specific methods to be called with a mock

Stub Syntax:
		
		# Syntax
		my_object.stub(:my_method).and_return(my_data)

		# Usage in this tutorial
		client.stub(:get).and_return(xml)

But don't forget:

**Context, Edge Cases, Corner Cases**

+ Writing examples for non-successful edge and corner cases
+ Organising examples into success and error contexts
+ Learning to think about ways things could go wrong
+ Discovering errors and anticipating them in your code
