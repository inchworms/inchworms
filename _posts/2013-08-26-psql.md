We found a new friend! After getting accustomed to our beloved irb we found a new very useful command. It's "psql". This command leads us to the PostgresSQL Interactive Terminal and is super helpful. The PostgresTerminal shows us all the databases and their contents, and we love it! Sometimes it has its tics. But who hasn't?

Today we intended to run a script which was supposed to put 278,601 rows into the database. After calculating that one row takes 4 seconds and that 278,602 rows would take us 1,114,404 seconds(i.e. 309 hours) we stopped the program. We had already spent enough time staring at the screen.

Here are some useful psql and sql commands:

		$ = Terminal   => = Postgres Interactive Terminal

		$ psql <name>             database terminal
		$ createdb <name>         create new database
		$ dropdb <name>           remove database
		$ psql -l                 shows all psql databases
		$ sudo su postgres        enter psql terminal as a superuser

		=> \q                     exit psql terminal
		=> \l                     shows all databases
		=> \connect <name>        connects to database
		=> \d                     show tables
		=> \d <table name>        show columns of table
		=> \d + <table name>      show columns with size & description

		SELECT * FROM <table name>;               get all content of table
		SELECT <column name> FROM <table name>;   self explanatory
		DROP TABLE <table name>;                  delete table
