It's the 20th of August already. That means we're already more than half way through our coding summer. As we went through our Sinatra refactoring with coach Matt this morning we realised how far we'd come in the last month and a half. Apart from things being waaaay less confusing, we also seem to know the right questions to ask. Inch by inch we're making progress :-)

The next step with our data viz project was to try and find someway of mapping zipcodes to geographical administrative regions. We found some useful data files that we were able to download at [geonames.org](http://geonames.org) and spent the rest of the day exploring what the files contained and how we would need to handle them, and our existing data files, and mash them into something our visualisations can use.

Also: [Adriaan](https://twitter.com/astellingwerff) came to visit. He had some tips for how we might set up our database and tables in it.
