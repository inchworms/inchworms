Today was our last day working from [Co-Up](https://twitter.com/co_up). We can't believe the month is almost over! We're really going to miss co-working, and co-lunching, with our developer friends here. 

For anyone who doesn't know, Co-Up generously offered us free desk space for the last month of our coding summer. They also threw in a free (and [famously hacked](http://inchworms.net/blog/2013-09-17-hardware-hack/) locker). Co-Up has an amazing record when it comes to supporting the local development community. They host many different developer-related [events](http://co-up.de/events.html) and are generally an amazing resource for Berlin developers. Since we're so grateful to them, not just for the desk we've worked from but for all the other great deeds they perform, we thought some farewell flowers were 	 in order.

We <3 you Co-Up.
