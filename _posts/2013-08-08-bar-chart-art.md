Today was spent reading our D3 primer [Interactive Data Vizualisation for the Web](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920026938.do). We really like this book, and are finding it an incredibly useful introduction to the javascript framework we'll most likely be using on our farmsubsidy.org project.

We worked through Chapter 5 and Chapter 6, progressing from generating page elements, to binding data, to drawing divs, to drawing svgs. Anja was, *naturlich*, very excited at the prospect of playing with different colours. She took the (rather bland) teal of the book's examples:
<p></p>

<p></p>
And turned it into a 'DarkRed', 'LightBlue', 'Orange' delight:

<p></p>
(For a list of CSS colour names we referred to the [W3C website](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp))

She also made the whole chart taller because she wanted it to fill her entire screen. 

Then [@bioshrimp](https://twitter.com/bioshrimp) came to visit for lunch. We sat on the roof and tried to look cool. Only @bioshrimp succeeded - no one with tats so good could ever look uncool :-)
