If the thought of setting up databases provokes this response:

FEAR NOT!!! 

Follow these simple steps instead:

(This is what we did to set up the (development) database we'll be using for our Farmsubsidy project).

1. Map out the basic data model on a piece of paper, including the relationships between each dataset/table (i.e. one to many, must have, zero or more).

2. Normalise (to get rid of repetition) or De-Normalise (to put it back when removing it is actually not totally logical or necessary)

3. Create a migration file. Name this using the Rails convention: date&timestamp_migration.rb. Store this file in db/migrations/ directory of your application.

4. Write the migration in Sequel, creating tables in the order required for any foreign keys between tables to compute.

5. Create a Rakefile. Write the migration methods here.

6. In terminal create the database (if you haven't already): **createdb databaseName**

7. Create a Gemfile that includes all required gems (in this case 'sequel', 'rake', and 'pg').

8. In terminal run **bundle install** to install the required gems localy

9. In terminal run **rake db:migrate** to run the migration and create all the tables in the database.

Then enjoy wearing your DataBase forehead sticker with pride:
