Today we needed some fresh air and followed an invitation by Maren, on of our rubymosters collegues. The idea was to sit in the garden and try to work on reflecting monitors. But the weather did not agree, so we stayed in the nice big kitchen.

Here we had some fruits and a quiet place with no distruction. Where we did some organising work and started our first test on the first sinatra app. Its testing whether the sites routes are available. It went green! 

      def test_root_returns_home
        get '/'
        assert last_response.ok?
      end

On monday we will start with rspec testing in sinatra by using that tutorial: 
[tutplus_sinatra_tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-integrate-rspec-into-a-sinatra-app/). 

We agreed to write more tutorial in the blog and leave the screencasts. Maybe later we are going to pick them up agaian. And for deploying the app to heroku via our Imacs we will update our ruby version there. Its just to hardcore with a Rubyversion 1.8.7.
