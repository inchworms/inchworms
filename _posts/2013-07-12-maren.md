Today while Carla met with her [DCA](http://handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c02020.html) supervisor (visting Berlin from Australia), Anja chased some much needed fresh air by accepting the invitation of Maren, a rubymosters collegue, to sit and work in her garden for the day. Unfortunately the weather did not agree, so she and Maren stayed in the nice big kitchen.

Snacking on fruits, and without distractions, Anja was able to get organised and start the first of our tests of the Sinatra app. It tests whether the sites routes are available. It went green! 

      def test_root_returns_home
        get '/'
        assert last_response.ok?
      end

On Monday we'll start with rspec testing by using this tutorial: 
[tutplus_sinatra_tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-integrate-rspec-into-a-sinatra-app/). 

And, after a long and devastating fight trying to deploy our Sinatra app to Heroku via our iMacs (both running ruby 1.8.7), a fight we didnt win, we agreed to write up a tutorial as a blog post instead and leave the screencasts for a while. We might pick them up again later. As for deploying via mac, if we ever do, we'll update our Ruby version first. We're actually pretty happy to get back to Ubuntu :-)
