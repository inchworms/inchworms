Today while Carla met with her [DCA](http://handbook.uts.edu.au/courses/c02020.html) supervisor (visting Berlin from Australia), Anja chased some much needed fresh air by accepting Maren's invitation to sit and work in her garden for the day (Maren, aka [@zaziemo](https://twitter.com/zaziemo), is one of our awesome [rubymonsters](https://github.com/rubymonsters) collegues). Unfortunately the weather did not agree, so they worked in Maren's comfortable kitchen instead.

While snacking on fruits, and without any distractions, Anja was able to get organised and start the first of our tests of the Sinatra app. It tests whether the sites routes are available. It went green! 

      def test_root_returns_home
        get '/'
        assert last_response.ok?
      end

On Monday we'll start with rspec testing by using this tutorial: 
[Tutplus Sinatra Tutorial](http://net.tutsplus.com/tutorials/ruby/how-to-integrate-rspec-into-a-sinatra-app/). 

And, after a long and devastating fight during the week trying to deploy our app to Heroku via our iMacs (both running ruby 1.8.7), a fight we didnt win, we agreed to write up the tutorial as a blog post instead and leave the screencasts for a while. We might pick them up again later. As for deploying via mac, if we ever do, we'll update our Ruby version first. We're actually pretty happy to get back to Ubuntu :-)
