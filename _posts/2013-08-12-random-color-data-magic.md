Today after Anja went nuts and Carla found the right music, we created a little video showing the beauty of data visualisation.

Then we did some more serious stuff with d3, like adding a mask, randomizing data, updating scales and axes. It was really heavy and Carla kept complaining about her [Narcolepsy](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Narkolepsie).

Afterwards we needed a "Luftzigarettenpause". Phew. I think Carla is already addicted.
