For some of us merging is the unavoidable consequence of a [dysfunctional intimate relationship](http://thebigbookofdating.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/rule-18-the-urge-to-merge/), for others it's simply an occupational hazard.

After over a year coding in teams with our fellow humans we are no longer scared of merge conflicts. We just roll out our terminal tools and RESOLVE:

And speaking of terminal tools, if you really want to make your co-workers vomit into their ASCII there's a way to format RSpec output with a variety of [emojis](https://github.com/cupakromer/emoji-rspec). Mac computers will have no trouble with these, but if you're running Ubuntu you'll need to install the [Symbola Unicode Font](http://users.teilar.gr/~g1951d/Symbola708.zip).
