    #inchworms on irc.freenode.net

We set up an IRC channel for any IM communication we need to do. Our GitHub repos are now configured with service hooks that will send notifications of any commits to the channel. 

[This page](http://www.geekshed.net/commands/chanserv/) was helpful in working out how to set up and register the channel. 

We promise we'll try not to use it to talk to each other when we're all sitting in the same room...
