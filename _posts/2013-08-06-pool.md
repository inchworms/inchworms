Another hot day in Berlin. Possibly not the best day to realise you need to renew your passport, but I guess not the worst (at least the queue at the Burgeramt was short - and no, Anja is not talking about hamburgers she's talking about [this place](http://www.bz-berlin.de/multimedia/archive/00370/Buergeramt_Hohensc_37069228.jpg)). 

It's the kind of day where working in an attic-floor office makes you sleepy and drowsy and yearning for a rooftop pool like this one:

So it was ice cream for lunch followed by more refactoring.

Carla's doctoral-project colleague [Dino](http://www.constantinekarlis.com/) sent through an interesting intro article on [NoSQL databases](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/630103/A-Beginners-Guide-to-NoSQL). It's relevant to the way the iOS app they're building is handling data, which as far as she understands is with a Graph Network model.

 Carla and RGSoC were also featured in an article on [women and technology](http://www.womensagenda.com.au/talking-about/top-stories/programming-a-woman-s-job-if-you-make-it-appealing/201308052658) in an Australian online magazine.
