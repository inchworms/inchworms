Today we went on with the Data Vizualisation book and read about scaling data values. As [Mike Bostock](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/quantitative-scales) says: <i>Scales are functions that map from an input domain to an output range.</i>

We used the learning-by-repetition style to drum the key D3 domain-range concept into our heads:

The next step in visualisation style were scatter plots. Once again, Anja took a simple scatter plot and fed it steroids:

All we need now is useful data. Give us data! We want to make [a scatter plot with meaning](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/17/business/dealbook/how-the-facebook-offering-compares.html), and not just pretty [colours](https://kuler.adobe.com/Theme-2-color-theme-2785170/edit/?copy=true):)...

Wishing you all a happy weekend!
