Here is our story:

We needed a locker at [Co-Up](https://twitter.com/co_up) coworking space. Alex and Aleks said there was a locker with a lost key, and that nobody was using it anymore. Alex joked that if we broke the padlock, the locker could be ours. Although he was only joking, we liked the sound of that challenge. Who doesn't like destroying padlocks??

Then,as if planets were aligning, coach [Matt](https://twitter.com/fidothe) turned up and mentioned that he had a junior hacksaw at home. We cycled to his home, fetched the hacksaw, and wasted no time in using it:

Three minutes later, the door to the locker was open. Our first hardware hack!

Soon afterwards we had lunch together at a local restaurant. By chance ended up sharing a table with [Cristina](https://twitter.com/crissantamarina). Christina is an organiser of Rails Girls and helps the coworking managers that use Co-Up's coworking tool, [@cobot_me](https://twitter.com/cobot_me). It was the first time we had met her. 

She asked about our day and we proudly told her we'd performed our very first hardware hack. We described breaking into locker number 7 and discovering its strange contents (a HUGE 5kg laptop charger from approx the year 1990). She looked confused. 

"Locker number 7?" She asked, "A Hewlett Pakard charger?" 

"Um... yes," we replied, our own frowns forming. 

It was Christina's locker. Sure, she hadn't used it in a while, but no(!) she had not lost the key.

We immediately apologised, and, lucky for us, Christina was totaly cool. "It's fine," she said, "seriously. No Problem."

We were relieved.

"But please," she added, as we continued eating, "stay away from my home."
