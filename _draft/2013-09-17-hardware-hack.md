Here is our story:

We needed a locker at the co-up coworking space. The co-up people told us there is one, were the key is lost and nobody sees to the locker anymore. So we just need to unlock it and then we get a new lock and everything is fine.

To be more precisely, we had to destroy the lock somehow.


Fortunately our coach matt was there and remembered that he has a junior hack saw at home. So we picked the saw up and startet to saw.

And in between some seconds (200 or something) we got the door unlocked. Our first hardware hack!

Later on we went having lunch together and meet [cristina](https://twitter.com/crissantamarina) one of the organiser of the rails girls. We talked about our day and what we did so far and found out that it was her locker we just broke in. She didn't know that the co-up people though it was abandonment and we all had a good laugh. Well maybe not all of us.
