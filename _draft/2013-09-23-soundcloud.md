Today we went to [soundclound](https://soundcloud.com/) to get some lessons in giving a talk.

As you all have probably noticed its just three more days until we fly to Kiew and attend the [Rubyshift](http://rubyshift.org/).

Since we are not very good and experienced speakers, (Juliane Peterson)(https://twitter.com/JulianePeterson) from soundcloud offered us to help. And it was a very needy help.

She tough us how to stand proberly:

  - your feed in soulder distance apart
  - bend the knees a little bit
  - relax your shoulders
  - lean the whole body forward


How to not fear the crowd:

  - its in our genes, the crowd in front of us is our enemy and we should not show any fear!
  - or else they gonna attack us


How to get the attention of the people:

  - talk in short sentences
  - repetition, repetition, repetition
  - pause a little bit in between ( especially hard for Anja )
  - funny pics are always good


It was great to talk to her and gave us a lot of confidence. Many many thanks!
